    "This is the notebook for performing inference with Llama3. The model was tested on the GoEmotions and TwitterData datasets, plus on GoEmotions in the Ekman labels version. We didn't perform a thorough mapping analysis like in the other transformers, due to the poor results. Note that the outputs of the cells are not present: due to the time and memory requirements of this model, it has been run on the remote machine, and the results saved on the .csv files (located in the \"results\" directory). The predictions have then been processed directly in the \"model_comparison\" notebook."
